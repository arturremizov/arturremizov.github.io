    <h1>Privacy Policy for Mix - Offline Music Player</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: August 16, 2024</strong></p>
    <p>This privacy policy describes how Mix - Offline Music Player ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personal information directly through the App. However, we use third-party services that may collect certain information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to help us understand how our App is being used and to improve its functionality. For more information, please see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Analytics' Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics collects information about your device and any crashes that occur within the App. This helps us identify and fix technical issues. For more information, please see <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Storage Services:</strong> The App can integrate with Google Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox to allow you to access and download your audio files. We do not store these files on our servers; the App merely facilitates access to your files on these cloud storage services. Please note that these services have their own privacy policies:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a></li>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion: Cloud Storage Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Download:</strong> The App allows you to connect to your cloud storage services, such as Google Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox, to access and download your audio files. Once you download a file to your device using the App, it is stored locally on your device.</li>

        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete any audio files downloaded to your device using the App's interface or through your device's file management system. The App does not automatically delete files, giving you full control over the retention and deletion of your audio files on your device.</li>
