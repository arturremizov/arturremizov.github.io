    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 14, 2024</p>

    <p>This privacy policy describes how <strong>MoodMaker - Daily Affirmations</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personal information directly through the App. However, we use third-party services that may collect certain information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>a) Usage Data:</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to help us understand how our App is being used and improve its functionality. This data may include app activity, pages viewed, and features used. We ensure that this data is anonymized and not linked to individual users. You can learn more by reviewing <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Analytics' Privacy Policy</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>b) Device Information:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics collects information about your device and any crashes that occur within the App to help us identify and resolve technical issues. This data may include information such as device type, operating system version, and IP address. All crash data collected is anonymized and is not associated with any identifiable user data.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Retention and Security</h2>
    <p>We retain anonymized data collected through Google Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics for a period of 24 months to help us analyze usage trends and improve app performance. After this period, all data is either deleted or further anonymized to maintain user privacy.</p>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect the anonymized data we collect. These measures include data encryption and secure transmission protocols. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing Features</h2>
    <p>Our App includes features that allow you to share content via iMessage, Instagram, and Facebook. When you use these features, the App opens the respective apps for sharing. We do not access your contacts or social media accounts.</p>
    <p>If the Facebook app is not installed on your device, you will be given the option to log in via a Web View within the App to enable sharing. Your interaction with Facebook through this Web View is governed by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy" target="_blank">Facebook's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>Any content you share via third-party services is subject to the privacy policies and terms of those platforms.</p>

    <h2>4. Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>We use push notifications to send affirmation reminders. You can manage or disable these notifications through the App settings at any time. The App does not collect personal data for notification purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
